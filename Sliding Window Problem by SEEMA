Problem Statement : Given an array of positive integers and the window size, find the maxima of the minima of the subarrays of the array.

Input : n - size of the array
        array elements - positive integers
        k - window size
output: maxima of minima of the subarrays

sample : Input :5 
                1 2 3 2 4 
                3
         Output: 2

Explaination - 1. For the first three elements (as k =3), minimum value is 1 ( out of 1 2 3).
               2. For the next window elements minimum value is 2 (out of 2 3 2).
               3.  For the next window elements minimum value is 2 (out of 3 2 4).
               4. Maximum of all the three subsets is 2, hence the output.
